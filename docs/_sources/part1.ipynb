    "### What is Mango Markets?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mango Markets provides a single venue to lend, borrow, swap, and leverage-trade crypto assets through a powerful risk engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Earn interest on deposits\n",
    "    * Cross-Margin / Cross-Collateralised\n",
    "    * Decentralised\n",
    "\n",
    "Mango Markets Documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.mango.markets/\n",
    "\n",
    "Mango Markets is built on the Solana blockchain and utilises Serum DEX for spot margin trading while perpetual futures are traded on Mango Markets' own order book. Mango Markets is governed by MNGO token holders via the Mango Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is still one massive holder with ~20x the amount of MNGO as the next biggest wallet.  It is unclear if this is Eisenberg, the MNGO Upgrade Committee, or somebody else.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Current MNGO Holders](holders.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A 4th version of Mango Markets is in development, but a release date has not been suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are \"perps\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Mango Markets docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Perpetuals allow initial leverage of up to 10x, and maintenance leverage of 20x. If the value of your position (or collateral) falls and your leverage exceeds 20x, your account will be eligible for liquidation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Perps are perpetual futures from a protocol that allows for high performance trades with no intermediaries or custodians, with options for offering liquidity or leverage on a variety of assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perps Documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.perp.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Price Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The mountainous region on the left is what normal trading looks like.  The ups and downs are relevant to the disparities among the prices.  The spike on the right is the Mango Markets Fiasco. Not hard to detect if it happens slowly.  Solana is known for being swift.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tiered scale benefits on the taker fee scheme, there is a fixed low fee for the maker rate, and borrowing and lending are free.  In essence, Eisenberg was completely valid in his statements about trading strategy."

Weeks later, the SEC cited these tweets as evidence that SBF “knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that by not mitigating for the impact of large and illiquid tokens posted as collateral by Alameda, FTX was engaging in precisely the same conduct, and creating the same risk, that he was warning against” with Mango.'\n",

There were still many holdout types waiting for the price to explode back to previous levels.  Perhaps these were mostly the dev team.  The timing may have been related to the security audit released September 02.\n",
